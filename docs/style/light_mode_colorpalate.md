DARREL - This may be incorrect at some spots

### Font & Typography

* **Font:** Urbanist
* **Main Text/Headings:** `#000000` (Black)
* **Sub Text:** `#8E7A9C` (Using a corrected version, as `#E7A9C` from the image is an invalid hex code).
* **Rule of thumb:** In light mode, keep text dark. Only use the `text-on-accent` token on clearly dark accent fills (e.g., a Dark Purple CTA). No ad-hoc white-on-wash treatments.

### Primary Palette

These colors now form the core brand identity with a bold and modern style.

---

**1. Main Purple**
* **Hex:** `#9B5DE5`
* **Usage Notes:** As the new primary brand color, this vibrant purple would be used for major calls-to-action, such as the `Login` and `Register` buttons. It could also highlight selected tabs in the navigation bar to draw user attention.

---

**2. Dark Purple**
* **Hex:** `#5D3889`
* **Usage Notes:** This deep, contrasting purple is perfect for primary text headings (like "Settings" or "Map") and important icons. It provides excellent readability and reinforces the new brand theme.

---

### Secondary & Accent Palette

These colors are used to differentiate content and highlight interactive elements in a dynamic way.

---

**3. Accent Pink**
* **Hex:** `#F15BB5`
* **Usage Notes:** This energetic pink would replace the soft green from the original design. It's ideal for use as a background color for a specific category of event cards (like "Park Potluck"), making the feed lively and easy to scan.

---

**4. Accent Blue**
* **Hex:** `#3EB8F0`
* **Usage Notes:** This bright, clear blue is the perfect accent for interactive elements. It would be used for hyperlinks, the user's own chat bubbles, and as a background highlight for another category of discussions (like "Superman Premiere").

---

### Neutral & Grayscale Palette

These colors provide a clean foundation, supporting the more vibrant primary and accent colors.

---

**5. Light Purple**
* **Hex:** `#CDAEF2`
* **Usage Notes:** This light purple would serve as the main background for UI elements like headers, footers, and input fields, replacing the original lavender. It provides a soft backdrop that is more colorful than plain white.

---

**6. Very Light Blue**
* **Hex:** `#ECF8FE`
* **Usage Notes:** This subtle, airy blue is an excellent replacement for light grey. It can be used for secondary backgrounds, such as the other person's chat bubbles or inactive buttons, to create a gentle sense of depth and separation.

---
**7. Pure White**
* **Hex:** `#FFFFFF`
* **Usage Notes:** White remains essential for the main content areas, ensuring that text and images have a clean, readable canvas.

### System & Semantic Palette

These colors for system status were not in your reference, so I've kept the standard, universally understood colors for the best user experience.

---

**8. System Green (Active Toggle)**
* **Hex:** `#34C759`
* **Usage Notes:** Used for the "on" state of toggle switches, indicating an active or enabled status.

---

**9. System Red (Error)**
* **Hex:** `#FF3B30`
* **Usage Notes:** Used for validation messages and error notifications to immediately alert the user to a problem.
