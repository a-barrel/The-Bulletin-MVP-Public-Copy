Profile banners (include option when editing profile)

A "Edit" button to edit your own pins (after they're created). 
And have it send updates to users who bookmarked
the pin that there's been changes (aside from user of course,
the person who edited it doesnt need an update)

-Add an update system when events are starting in 2 hours
-Add an update when discussions a user has replied too
will expire in a day

On the map, in the top right, 
under the button that navigates to pin creation ,
include 3 sliders to turn on/off:
1. Event on/off
2. Discussion on/off
3. Personal Pins on/off

And use the SVGs/Symbols we used on the map with same colors
next to the sliding toggle so they know which slider is linked
to which pin type through the color.
