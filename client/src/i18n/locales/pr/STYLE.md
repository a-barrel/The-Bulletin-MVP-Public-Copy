# Pirate Locale — Style Guide (Quick Reference)

- Tone: playful, nautical, first/second person (“ye”, “yer”, “matey”), light contractions.
- Vocabulary: ship terms (deck, berth, cabin, parrot, treasure, chart, crew), avoid modern slang.
- Punctuation: keep placeholders and punctuation from English; end sentences with periods where original did.
- Names: keep feature names recognizable (“Map”, “Pins”, “Settings”) with a pirate hint rather than obscuring meaning.
- Placeholders: never change keys like `{{count}}` or `{name}`; keep capitalization consistent.
- Buttons/CTAs: short verbs (“Hoist”, “Sign”, “Reset”), avoid overlong strings to prevent truncation.
